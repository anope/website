Today is an exciting day â€¦ (Ok, it's 2 days to my birthday but that's not what I'm talking about!).

We've been in talks with the Denora Stats team and are proud to announce that Denora will merge their knowledge and features back into Anope 1.9 as an optional Statserv module. This we feel collectively will give our users the 
<br/>
best of both worlds, a second to none IRC Services platform combined with a feature rich and ever evolving Statistics package.

A bit of history will show that Denora forked our base core back in the early 1.7 releases and built upon it, improving and growing their own ideas and functions in whilst allowing us to backport some changes back into our own 
<br/>
core but with the plans for Anope 1.9 to be as open and architectually flexible as possible we figured it would make sense to hit the ground running!

In the future, we will be looking for competent module authors with popular modules to maintain them whilst we bundle them with the actual product as an optional convenience for users with the eventual idea that some of the modules may either be merged into the core, or that the module author extends their skills and joins our team and developing the product overall.

We are always looking for people who want to help out, even if you don't think you have anything useful to offer, feel free to get hold of me on irc or via email (chaz@anope.org) and we'll see how we can work together.

In other news:
<br/>
Anope 1.8 is almost complete now with the final couple of bugs in the throws of being completed.

Anope 1.9 is making fast paced and good development and we'd welcome any feature requests etc on our forum as previously outlined in our news.
