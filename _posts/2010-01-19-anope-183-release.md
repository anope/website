6 months since the last stable branch update, we are pleased to announce the immediate availability of Anope 1.8.3.

This release brings to the table several bug fixes and official support for InspIRCd 1.2.

We have also taken the decision to move to Visual Studio 2008 for our precompiled Windows versions. This means that if you do not already have 2008 Runtimes you will need those but as several module authors have already moved to this version you may already have them.

You can download them from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf&displaylang=en">here</a>.

As with all of our releases we would recommend you take a known good back up and perform testing in a testnet environment with your current databases and modules before considering upgrading your live network. We would however recommend anyone using any versions of 1.6, 1.7 or 1.8 to update as soon as possible.

We would like to extend our thanks to the networks which helped us test this new version and would welcome anyone else to get in touch to help us form a 'Release Testing Team' in order to provide a more structured and efficient testing and release pattern.
