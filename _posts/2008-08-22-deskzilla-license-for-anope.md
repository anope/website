ALMWorks have issued a Deskzilla License for our bugtracking system so our users can navigate our historical bugs archive with ease.

Users can download Deskzilla from ALMWorks website at https://www.almworks.com and our license can be found at https://www.anope.org/deskzilla_anope.license

We are very grateful to ALMWorks for their support over the years in providing prior to the public license; licenses for our team individually.
