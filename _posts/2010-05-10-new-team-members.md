Just a very short announcement to welcome Phil & Lethality to the Team.

Phil comes from a long established Anope network and has always been chirpy in his support of the project so we're thrilled he wants to commit some time and energy into helping take Anope further.

Lethality comes from one of our sponsors and has been a frequently abused supporter for some time with us. (He's also the windows man for those people too lazy to compile their own modules!)

What they don't realise is what they've let themselves in for:)
