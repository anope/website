Today we are announcing the release of Anope 1.8.9, which includes minor bug fixes and support for Hybrid 8.1.

With the release of Anope 2 later this month, Anope 1 will be officially moved to "Legacy" status and we will no longer be recommending users use it.
<br/>
As such, this will be the last release of the Anope 1 branch.

However we will continue to support users running Anope 1.8.x until at least March 23, 2015, at which point we will reevaluate the situation.
<br/>
The downloads will also remain on <a href="https://anope.org">anope.org</a> until at least this time.
