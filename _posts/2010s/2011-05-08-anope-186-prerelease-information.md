Hi all,

We believe we're ready to release Anope IRC Services 1.8.6 as our next stable release.

Before we do this though we'd like to involve the community in testing our pre build just to make sure everything is OK and contribute back to the project with your findings.

We'll leave this open for a week with a view of releasing next weekend if all is OK.

There will be no other commits to stable in the meantime unless issues are found in these builds.
