BEGIN SUMMARY
Anope 1.7.16 has been released as a second release candidate for our next stable release, Anope 1.8.0. With quite a number of fixes since the previous release, we strees everyone again to test this release as much as possible.
END SUMMARY
-->

After many weeks of testing Anope 1.7.15, we found a small number of bugs and oddities which have been fixed in this release. Due to the number and the kind of bugs fixed, we require another testing period. We would like to get as many people as possible to test Anope 1.7.16 and report any bugs found to our bugtracker, located at <a href="https://bugs.anope.org">https://bugs.anope.org/</a>.

Highlights include support for the latest Platform SDK on Windows, improved support for plexus3, and various small language tweaks. Additionally, the MySQL code has been tweaked, make can now handle multiple jobs at the same time, and various compiler warnings have been eliminated.

Source and Windows Binary files can be downloaded from our file releases section at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=94081&package_id=100358&release_id=454141">SourceForge</a>.
