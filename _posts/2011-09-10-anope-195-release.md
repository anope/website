The Anope Team are proud to announce the release of Anope 1.9.5. This release continues the development of our development branch in creating the next generation Anope 2.0 stable.

The configuration has been split up in to multiple separate files, so any admins switching from older 1.9 versions may want to completely redo their configuration file (and enjoy the new options!).

Some of the notable changes include:
<br/>
Extended LDAP support
<br/>
Added os_oper, os_kill, os_forbid, m_statusupdate, cs_sync, and bs_autoassign
<br/>
Added a new configuration file format
<br/>
Added a new commands system
<br/>
Added a new access system, and cs_flags

Additionally, we have taken the time to patch the previous 1.9.4 release and are releasing it as 1.9.4-p1, for those who prefer to stay on the more stable side of 1.9 development.

Last, but not least, our project leader chaz has stepped down after leading the Anope Team for almost three years to attend to real life. Chaz was instrumental in late 1.7 development and releasing 1.8 stable, as well as kick starting 1.9 development off to its bright future. We thank him greatly for the time he has put in to Anope to make it better and we wish him the best of luck in life. DukePyrolator has stepped up from his role as a developer to fill the open position of project leader.
