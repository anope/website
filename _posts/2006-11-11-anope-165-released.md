BEGIN SUMMARY
Over a year after the release of Anope 1.6.4, the Anope Team releases a minor update to the stable series of Anope.
END SUMMARY
-->

After more than a year since the release of Anope 1.6.4, the Anope Team brings forward a minor update to the stable series of Anope. An issue with modern versions of perl caused Anope 1.6.4 to not compile correctly on a number of modern systems. The release of Anope 1.6.5 fixes this issue.<br />
<br />
Please note that this update is meaningless for anyone already running a development version (1.7.x) of Anope.<br />
<br />
The source for this release can be downloaded from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=94081&package_id=99987&release_id=462815">SourceForge</a>.
