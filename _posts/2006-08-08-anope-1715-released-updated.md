BEGIN SUMMARY
This release contains a huge number of bugfixes, and is the feature freeze release for Anope 1.8.0. We encourage you to test this version and report any bug you find on the bugtracker at <a href="https://bugs.anope.org/">https://bugs.anope.org/</a>.
END SUMMARY
-->

This release contains a huge number of bugfixes, resulting in an empty bug-tracker at the time of release. We would like to get as many people as possible to test this release and report any found bugs on our bugtracker, located at <a href="https://bugs.anope.org">https://bugs.anope.org/</a>. This release is a complete feature freeze for our upcoming new stable release, 1.8.0, and therefore requires as much testing as possible.

Highlights in this version include the removal of the old KillClones code; session limiting should be used at all times. We also moved the previously bundled ns_noop module into the core, and improved Windows-support by adding support for Visual Studio 2005. The complete list of changes can be found in the changelog, bundled as the Changes file, or to be found on <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=438139&group_id=94081">SourceForge</a>.

The precompiled Windows versions from now on require the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=32bc1bee-a3f9-4c13-9c99-220b62a191ee&DisplayLang=en">Visual C++ 2005 Runtimes</a>, and version 5.0 of <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html">MySQL</a>. Older versions are no longer supported by our precompiled binaries.

This release can be downloaded from our file releases section at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=94081&package_id=100358&release_id=438139">SourceForge</a>.


<b>Update:</b> The Windows installers have been re-uploaded after an issue was discovered. The md5 sums in the release notes have been updated to reflect the changes. Thanks to Jobe for letting us know of this issue.
