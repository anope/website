title: Translators wanted!

We're currently looking for contributors to help update the Anope translations.

The following translations are extremely outdated and will be removed in a future 2.1 release if they are not updated:

- Catalan (ca_ES)
- Hungarian (hu_HU)
- Portuguese (pt_PT)
- Russian (ru_RU)
- Turkish (tr_TR)

The following translations are somewhat outdated and just need to have some messages updated:

- Dutch (nl_NL)
- French (fr_FR)
- Greek (el_GR)
- Spanish (es_ES)

If you want to translate Anope to a language which it is not currently translated to then your contribution would also be welcome.


If you're interesting in helping out please see [issue #337](https://github.com/anope/anope/issues/337) and read `docs/LANGUAGE` for information on how to translate Anope.
