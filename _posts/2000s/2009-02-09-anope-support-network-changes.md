We'd like to announce that we've recently migrated our support network (irc.anope.org) over onto InspIRCd 1.2 and have started to use our own new development builds (1.9.0) from SVN.

Many people have asked us why we made this move both to InspIRCd and indeed why we'd leave the comfort of a stable release to use development (potentially unstable) versions and I have answers for you.

We chose InspIRCd as it's a well maintained, highly motivated and definitely innovative product and we (Anope) should be are the forefront of the technology for the sake of our users. (Ok, and our own selfish lust to play with new shiny things!)

We decided also to make the move from Anope 1.8 to 1.9 for a few reasons, namely to put our money where our mouth is and start to push the game forward by showing it's developing fast and taking strides forward. We also wanted to be able to have users experience it for themselves without the need for a testnet or taking the plunge until their ready.

Finally we figured that if we use Anope 1.9 with InspIRCd we'd be helping both teams find/fix bugs as we are all in the same game at the end of the day; to provide reliable, and feature packed IRC 'Services' to administrators & users alike.

There is no political motive to our move; we merely want to further the compatibility efforts with InspIRCd and with the news of the Unreal project forking InspIRCd for their next major version we might aswell get in on the ground with InspIRCd.

In other news, we're aiming for a release of Anope 1.9.0 as the first milestone in the development since it started it's development over on C++ and we'd like everyone to get involved with us in testing and suggesting new features on the forum <a href="https://forum.anope.org/index.php?board=9.0">here</a> and reporting any bugs to us on the Bugtracker <a href="https://bugs.anope.org">here</a><br/>

Looking forward to hearing from you!
