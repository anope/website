The Anope Team are pleased to announce a small updated release from 1.8.1 to 1.8.2.

This release fixes two problems introduced in 1.8.1 centric to MySQL and a Nickserv Logout bug. - Neither issue is exploitable by a normal user on your network.

We would as always recommend all users upgrade at their earliest convenience.
