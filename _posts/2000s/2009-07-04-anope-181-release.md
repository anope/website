The Anope Team are proud to announce the immediate availability of Anope 1.8.1 (Stable).

This release comes 6 months after the debut of Anope 1.8.0 as our new stable branch and brings several bugfixes. 

We would recommend that anyone using 1.8.0 (or 1.6.x/1.7.x) install this upgrade.

Once again on behalf of the project I'd like to thank our team with the new members who have joined us since our last release and of course the Anope Community for their continuing use of the product.
