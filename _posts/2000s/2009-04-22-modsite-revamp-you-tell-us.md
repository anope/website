There's been a lot of progress made recently, and as you may have noticed we've been busy trying to get things up to date as well as rebuilding the community.

That being said, it's time to rethink the modsite. The current modsite isn't bad, but it's hard to admin and users have requested features here and there along the way. We're currently looking for input from end users to decide the future of the site: Should we modify the existing one? Should we redo it completely?

We need your help! If you have something you would like to add, there is a nice discussion on the forum about it that can be found <a href="https://forum.anope.org/index.php?topic=2705.0">here</a>. Please take some time to tel us what you think.
