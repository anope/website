We are considering opening up International Support Forums & expanding the use of International Language Specific IRC Channels on irc.anope.org.

If anyone is multilingual including English and wishes to maintain a channel for their language and/or Forum on our web forums please email chaz@anope.org and outline why it should be you and not someone else.

We look forward to hearing from you soon.
