We have <a href="https://sourceforge.net/people/?group_id=94081">opened a few positions</a> for the Anope Project. Some are technical, others are not. If you are into Anope, want to help and be part of the next stable release, please read on.

We posted several opening at sf.net describing the positions. It is all for the money, fame, and glory. Well... there is no money involved. And the fame is very little. But the glory makes up for it all. Consider that Anope is one of most used set of IRC services in the world. Our customer base include thousands of IRC networks from small to mega-huge. We make IRC a more civilized place to inhabit. 

Take a look at our <a href="https://sourceforge.net/people/?group_id=94081">recruitment page</a>.
