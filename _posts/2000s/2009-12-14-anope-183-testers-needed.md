Hi folks,

As Christmas draws nearer and the time to develop shortens (in lieu of the increased time spent drinking and socialising with the family) we're once again looking out to the community to help make a difference.

We're almost ready for the release of Anope 1.8.3 including InspIRCd 1.2 Support, some fixes in XOP, & more general tidying up of issues picked up on during the overhaul in devel.

The Changes file is below thus far and we would very much like to see people coming forward to test this release before it goes live.

If we don't get enough support it will not be released until after Christmas and into the New Year.

So, if you want to help Anope help your community email chaz@anope.org with details of your network (current anope version, current user size, number of servers, OS of services server) and I will reply with the terms of testing to ensure we're all on the same page.

Thanks.
