We have as part of our movement forward with 1.8-stable cleared the old mailing list for Anope Users.

To keep up to date on Anope Release Information, Insider Information, and General Anope News please sign up for our Users Mailing list located at 

<a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/anope-users">https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/anope-users</a><br/>

This list will soon to be buzzing with information from the Anope Team and you too can become more involved as part of our Testing Network Group (netqa).
