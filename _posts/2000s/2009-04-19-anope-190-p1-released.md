<b>Backdated to 16/04/09</b>

The Anope Team are pleased to announce the availability of Anope 1.9.0-p1 (Patch 1) which fixes several bugs within the original 1.9.0 release back in February.

The Team have taken the historically unusual step of making this build available prior to the release of 1.9.1 which is still under development so that users can take advantage of the fixes being employed without risk of introducing potentially new risks with the ongoing development.

We hope that this patched build will be of use to the contributors making use of the development branch this early in its conception. We are very grateful to them for their support and contributions.
