Morning,

Very quick announcement to let you all know that the Anope Modsite has been taken outside, kicked about a bit and brought back in with LDAP support and many legacy issues resolved.

A big thanks to Adam for abusing it into playing ball and I hope it continues to serve as a valued resource for the community.

So.. If you don't have an LDAP account, get one at https://login.anope.org.

Any problems, let us know and we'll investigate.
