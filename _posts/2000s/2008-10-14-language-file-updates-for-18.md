Hi all,

Just a quick note to tell you that if you're working on any language file updates to please let us know and they need to be finished and submitted by the 26th of October at the very latest for inclusion in Anope 1.8.

We would appreciate your help in checking out the langfile in your language and reporting any mistakes so we can get them up to date and ready to rock for 1.8 which is coming ... :)

Thanks for your time.
