The Anope Team are proud to announce that after two years of development our latest stable release Anope 1.8.0 is now available for download.

It's been a long couple of years, with many changes both to the product and indeed to the team as a whole.

For those of you with Modules which won't work beyond 1.7.21 we understand your plight and will be available to assist module authors if they need a hand revising their mods for general consumption.

We want everyone to move away from 1.7.x as a development branch and join us on -stable. (with your modules of course!)

We'd like to once again wish our loyal users all the very best in this holiday season and for all to have a successful year in 2009.
