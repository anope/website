We're reviewing which IRCds we support and would like feedback from our community as to which they use, and whether they would like to see anything new added to the mix.

Please register for our forum at our centralised user system <a href="https://login.anope.org">here</a> and have your opinion heard on our forum poll/thread <a href="https://forum.anope.org/index.php?topic=2830">here</a>.

We need your feedback to make Anope better.
