We're pleased to announce the availability of 1.9.2-p2 which is a second patch release of the recent 1.9.2.

This release includes full support for InspIRCd 2.0's m_customprefix module and some other InspIRCd specific improvements.

This release also includes several general fixes which users of 1.9 generally should consider upgrading for.

Finally, users of 1.9.2 and 1.9.2-p1 should install this new version as there is a known issue with a certain nick drop event leading to a crash.
