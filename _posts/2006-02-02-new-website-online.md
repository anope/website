BEGIN SUMMARY
It has taken some time, but the new site is finally online. This new site will contain our news, documentation, and support resources.
END SUMMARY
-->

It has taken some time, but the new site is finally online. We once again are able to host our own <a href="https://forum.anope.org/">forums</a>, and have a fully working <a href="https://bugs.anope.org/">bug tracker</a> once again.</p>
<p>This new site allows us to add more information and facilities than our old site did. We currently offer a web-based version of the <a href="https://anope.org/new/faq.php">FAQ</a> and links to documentation for <a href="http://anope.zero.org/docgen/en_us/">users</a> and <a href="http://anope.zero.org/doxy/">developers</a>. Copies of the documentation bundled with anope and other helpful resources will be added later.</p>
<p>We want to thank <a href="http://searchirc.com">SearchIRC</a> for hosting forums for us during the time we were unable to do so. Pay them a visit sooner or later, they're a great site even without Anope forums ;) Please use the forums on our site from now on, as the forums on SearchIRC will be shut down in the near future.
