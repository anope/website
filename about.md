Anope is a set of IRC Services forked from Epona early 2003 to pick up where Epona had been abandoned. Ever since there have been improvements on quality and functionality of Anope, resulting in the feature rich set of services we offer today.

There are two releases of Anope available, allowing you to pick what is best for your net. The stable releases we offer are snapshots of the development series which are being continually tested, resulting in a very stable yet powerful set of services. The development releases are where the real work happens. New features get implemented in development release, resulting in a package that defines the future of IRC Services today.

We offer various services clients to maintain your IRC network. Every service is aimed at one goal, offering a complete set of features for the given goal.

**NickServ** &mdash; nickname management services. NickServ allows your users to register their nickname to prevent others from stealing their nickname. Your users will also be able to kill any ghost connections with their nickname and will be able to group their most-used nicknames together so they can use the same set of settings and access for all of their nicknames.

**ChanServ** &mdash; channel management services. ChanServ provides the ability to register your channels. This way ChanServ can be used to give channel operator status to regular operators, or to lock other modes or a topic for your channel. Our version of ChanServ provides a very complete set of features for channel management, allowing complete control over your channel.

**MemoServ** &mdash; send memos to users or channels. MemoServ offers a way to send short messages to users who are currently offline, or to entire channels if you wish. This allows you and your users to quickly tell offline users something, without a chance of forgetting it.

**OperServ** &mdash; operator utility services. OperServ provides a very complete set of functionality for IRC Operators, allowing them to operate their network in a very efficient way. Including often used features like akills and session limiting, this black box for IRC Operators ensures a safe and easy to manage IRC network.

**BotServ** &mdash; channel bot services. BotServ allows you to create several bots for your network. These bots can join channels and take over most actions from ChanServ, making things just a tad more intuitive. Additionally, BotServ also adds a few features like fantasy commands and kick triggers.

**HostServ** &mdash; virtual host services. HostServ offers a way to easily provide virtual hosts to the users on your network. If your IRCd supports virtual hosts HostServ can be used as a very easy interface for setting them, and enables the virtual host every time a user joins the network.

**Global** &mdash; global noticer. Global allows you to send global notices to everyone on your IRC network.
